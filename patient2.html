Patient safety is a healthcare discipline that emphasizes 

on the reporting, analysis, and prevention of medical error, 

physician error, medication error, pharmacy error, nursing 

error, medical equipment failure, root cause analysis, and 

failure due to human factors. Negligence in patient safety 

often leads to adverse healthcare events. Lovely Group of 

Hospitals as well as its employees actively participates in 

patient safety as partners to the patients. At Lovely, 

we improve patient safety through our infection control

 practices, prevention programmes, patient awareness programmes

 and other safety procedures. Lovely practices patient safety by 

Using good hospital design principles Limiting shift durations for 


medical residents and other hospital staff Preventing central 
\
line-related blood stream infections Educating patients about 

using blood thinners safely Building rapid response systems 

and better teams Re-engineering hospital discharges thus 

reducing potentially preventable readmissions by assigning 

a staff member to work closely with patients and other staff 


to settle medications and schedule necessary follow-up medical 

appointments. Preventing venous thromboembolism by eliminating 

hospital-acquired VTE (venous thromboembolism), the most common 

cause of preventable hospital deaths. Some safety tips for patients 

to make sure that the care is as safe as possible. Keep the latest 

list of the following with you at all times: Your immunizations,

 prior hospitalizations and medical problems The name and phone number

 of your pharmacy and physician Any allergies you have to medicine, 

food or anything else Learn about your illness and how to stay healthy. 

Ask a family member or friend to go with you to the doctor to help you 

ask questions or get further information. Cooperate with your doctor

 by answering the questions about your illness in order to understand 

and plan for your care. Let your physician know if you are not feeling 

well or if you experience any change in your condition. While in the hospital:

 Wash your hands with soap and water, especially after using the restroom and 

before eating Ask everyone who comes in contact with you, visitors or staff,

 to wash their hands. This will reduce your exposure to germs Use Medications

 Safely Keep the latest list of drugs you are taking including prescriptions,

 herbals, vitamins, or any other medicines. Bring your list of prescriptions 

with you every time you go to the hospital or visit your doctor. Make sure you 


know the names of all your medicines and why you were prescribed to take them. 

Ask questions about any instructions or information given that are confusing or

 unclear. When a doctor suggests you a new medicine, ask him/her if the new medicine 

will interfere with or substitute for what you are already taking. If you are concerned

 with any safety issues, please speak with Patient Relation Executive (PRE) or manager

 (operations) or any member of the hospital staff. We will do our best to resolve your problem.

 Immediately contact your doctor, nurse or attender if you do not feel well after taking a medicine.
