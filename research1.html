introduction

Research is one of the cornerstones of the Lovely Hospitals 

in its mission to provide quality healthcare accessible to 

all sections of the society. Whether in the laboratory or 

in the hands-on environment of our clinics, 

Lovely Hospitals is committed to the continuous 

pursuit of knowledge that improves the delivery of medical care.


The Lovely Research Foundation supports research grants under

 YAMER (Lovely Academy of Medical Education and Research) 

by providing the platform technologies and research programmes, 

administrative support, staff, and facilities that are needed to

 rapidly translate discoveries made in the laboratory and the

 hospital into new diagnostics, and treatments.

At Lovely Hospitals our doctors and scientists collaborate across 

disciplines and specialties under the guidance of Ethics Committee,

 and it is this co-existence of experience and expertise that fosters 

translational research – turning basic science into new procedures and

 new therapies giving patients innovative and excellent care.


Our commitment is simple – To develop and transform the most innovative 


science and technology into useful realities for our patients.
