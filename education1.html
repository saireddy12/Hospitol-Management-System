Lovely Hospitals is a leading healthcare provider. 
The hospital provides patients with the latest technological innovations for 
diagnosis and treatment of the most acute clinical conditions.
 The hospital admits and cures over 3 lakh patients each year.
 This is made possible by the compassionate care and expertise
 of doctors providing the “Healing Touch” to the patients.

We started with 25 doctors and about 80 nurses.
 Today, we are empowered by 415 doctors and 1100 nurses. 
We are now a 3200-member family that provides round the clock personalized 
attention and care.

Lovely’s vision to provide the best & affordable health care in India has 
stood the test of time. 
For the last 15 years, Lovely has been providing cutting-edge technology 
combined with the latest medical procedures

In addition to this, streamlined information flows through our sophisticated 
information system, 
improved diagnostic capabilities, and caring disposition; have positioned us 
as one of the most trusted hospital in Telangana. 
It is a little wonder that we treat the most number of patients in the city.
 Lovely has been rated as Hyderabad’s Best Hospital by a survey recently 
conducted by The Week Magazine.

We have moved from being solely focused on solving our patient’s problems, 
to addressing issues that concern the medical fraternity and the society.
 We have embarked on a dream. 
To make world-class healthcare affordable to people for all sections of 
the society. 
We are recognized as leaders in the field of health. Our doctors regularly 
publish scientific papers in national & international journals.
